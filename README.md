# pip-chrome-extension

**pip-chrome-extension** is a Chrome browser extension that enables Picture-in-Picture-mode via the browser-native [Picture-in-Picture API](https://css-tricks.com/an-introduction-to-the-picture-in-picture-web-api/).

## Installation

Get a copy of the browser extension.

Either clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com/sophiabrandt/pip-chrome-extension pip-chrome-extension
```

Or download the zip file from the zip folder.

Install the [unpacked extension in Chrome](https://webkul.com/blog/how-to-install-the-unpacked-extension-in-chrome/).

## Usage

Click on the browser extension icon (a camera icon). It will open a new tab.

You can now select the stream you want to see (a separate Chrome tab, a Youtube video running in another tab, etc.).

## Acknowledgments

The core idea and basic code is from [Jacinto Wong](https://github.com/JacintoDesign)'s JavaScript [course](https://zerotomastery.io/about/instructor/jacinto-wong/).

I added a few bells and whistles, and use different techniques for [styling the CSS](https://every-layout.dev/).
